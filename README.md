sqleditor.net
=============

A .net port of the sqleditor python repository

This port is not yet production ready. The only purpose of this .Net port was for fun and due to a limitation in deploying the project within an IIS and .Net only environment.

It relies on the sqleditor repository static files which need to be placed in the static folder of this project.
